# Acrylic transparent and responsive Discord themes 

## Simple install:

- Use [**Vesktop**](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases) (faster and more lightweight) or [**Vencord**](https://vencord.dev/download/)
- Add the theme URLs to **[ Options ] > [ Themes ] > [ Online Themes ]**:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes/main/smooth-harmony-responsive.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes/main/acrylic-harmony-fully-transparent.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s-k-y-l-i/discord-themes/main/acrylic-harmony-transparent-frame.css
```
#### Enabling transparency:
 - Enable transparency in **[ Vesktop Settings ] > [ Transparency Options ]** <br>
   or **[ Vencord ] > [ Enable Window transparency ]**
 - For even better experience, I recommend to also use Mica for Everyone, available [here](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases).
 - If using multiple themes, <u>**place Acrylic theme for last**</u>!

#### Acrylic Harmony - Fully Transparent
This Discord theme adds the translucent Mica effect to your whole Discord client background. It's compatible with all of the Nitro Themes.  

#### Acrylic Harmony - Transparent Frame
Transparency on titlebar and server sidebar only.

#### Smooth Harmony
A Discord theme to remove the clutter and make it able to responsively resize to smaller sizes. It's also working with all the colorful Discord Nitro themes, including dark and light themes. It's pleasant to the eyes and easy to use.
