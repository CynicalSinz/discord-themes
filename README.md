# Acrylic Harmony and Smooth Responsive Themes 

## Simple install:

- Use [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases)(It's faster) or [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/download/)
- Add the theme URLs to [ Options ] > [ Themes ] > [ Online Themes ]:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyli91/discord-themes/main/responsive%20and%20simple.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyli91/discord-themes/main/transparency%20for%20nitro%20themes%20too.css
```
For Acrlyic themes:
 - Enable transparency in the Discord options! 
 - For even better experience, I recommend to also use Mica for Everyone, available [here](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases).
 - If using multiple themes, <u>**place Acrylic theme for last**</u>!

## Acrylic Harmony Fully Transparent

This Discord theme adds the translucent Mica effect to your Discord client. It's compatible with all of the Nitro Themes, be it dark or light.  

## Acrylic Harmony Transparent Frame

If you want to only enable transparency on titlebar and server sidebar, install this.

## Smooth Harmony

A Discord theme to remove the clutter and make it able to responsively resize to smaller sizes. It's also working with all the colorful Discord Nitro themes, including dark and light themes. It's pleasant to the eyes and easy to use.
