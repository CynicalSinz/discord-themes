## Acrylic Harmony

This Discord theme adds the translucent Mica effect to your Discord client. It's compatible with all of the Nitro Themes, be it dark or light.  

### ~ Important notes
 - Enable transparency in the Discord options. 
 - For even better experience, I recommend to also use Mica for Everyone, available [here](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases).
 - If using multiple themes, <u>**place Acrylic theme for last**</u>!
