# Installation Guide

## Simple install:

- Add the following URLs to [ Options ] > [ Themes ] > [ Online Themes ]:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyli91/discord-themes/main/responsive%20and%20simple.css
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyli91/discord-themes/main/transparency%20for%20nitro%20themes%20too.css
```

## Responsive and Simple Theme:

- Ensure you have Vesktop installed with transparency options enabled. Get it [here](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop/releases).
- For even better experience, I recommend to use Mica for Everyone, available [here](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone/releases).
- If using multiple themes, <u>**place this one last**</u>.
